# MagicSquare
We define a magic square to be an " n x n "  matrix of distinct positive integers from  1 to  n^2 where the sum of any row, column, or diagonal of length n is always equal to the same number: the magic constant.
You will be given a "3 x 3" matrix s of integers in the inclusive range . We can convert any digit a to any other digit b in the range [1-9] at cost of [a-b] . Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.
